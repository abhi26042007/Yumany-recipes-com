                <section>
                    Indian mango pickle, or Aam Ka Achar, is a staple condiment made from raw, unripe green mangoes preserved with a mixture of spices, 
                    salt, and oil. It is known for its bold, tangy, spicy flavor and can be stored for months or even a year if prepared and stored correctly.

                        The History of Indian mango pickle dates back to ancient times as a method of preserving the seasonal mango,
                        Over centuries, different regions of India developed unique regional variations, like Andhra's avakaya, by adding specific
                         spices and oils to the basic preservation technique.

                        The process of making pickles often became a family tradition, with recipes being passed down through generations.

                            Traditional Mango Pickle (Sun-Cured): Preparation and initial mixing take about 30 to 60 minutes,
                            followed by a maturation period where the pickle is kept in the sun for 1 to 4 weeks (or even up to a month or more) until the mango pieces soften and all the flavors are absorbed.

                <ol type="a">
                    <h3><strong>Ingredients:-</strong></h3>
                    <li>Raw Green Mangoes: Firm and unripe, often cut into cubes.</li>
                    <li>Mustard oil is popular in the North due to its pungent flavor and preservative qualities, while sesame or groundnut oil is typically used in the South.</li> 
                    <li>Spices: Mustard seeds (powdered), fenugreek seeds (methi dana), fennel seeds (saunf), nigella seeds (kalonji), red chili powder, turmeric powder, and asafoetida (hing) are standard additions.</li> 
                    <li>Salt: Essential for flavor and preservation.</li>
                    <li>Optional: Garlic cloves or vinegar may be added depending on the regional style. </li> 
                    
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    <h3><strong> Step by step-Instructions:- </strong></h3>
                    <li> Days 1-2: Prepare the Mangoes</li>
                    <li> Wash and Dry: Wash the raw mangoes thoroughly and dry them completely with a clean kitchen towel. Ensure absolutely no moisture remains, as this can spoil the pickle.</li>
                        <li>Cut: Cut the mangoes into bite-sized (about 1-inch) pieces, discarding the inner seed.</li>
                         <li>Salt and Turmeric: In a large, dry bowl, toss the mango pieces with salt and turmeric powder until evenly coated.</li>
                         <li>Sun-Dry/Rest: Cover the bowl (or spread pieces on a tray) and leave it in direct sunlight for 1-2 days to help them dehydrate slightly and release moisture. Stir them once or twice daily. </li> 
                         <li>Day 3: Prepare the Spices and Combine </li>
                         <li> Roast and Grind Spices: Dry roast the fenugreek and mustard seeds in a pan over low heat until they are aromatic. Let them cool completely, then grind them into a coarse powder. </li>
                         <li> Heat and Cool Oil: Heat the mustard oil in a pan until it reaches its smoking point (this removes its pungent raw smell and helps preserve the pickle). Turn off the heat and allow the oil to cool completely to room temperature. </li>
                         <li>  Mix Everything: In the large bowl with the mango pieces, add the ground spice mixture, red chili powder, and any other optional spices like fennel or nigella seeds. Mix very well with a clean, dry spoon. </li>
                         <li>  Add Oil: Pour the cooled oil over the mango-spice mixture and stir until all the pieces are evenly coated. The oil should form a thin layer on top.  </li>
                         <li> Days 4-10: Maturation and Storage</li>
                         <li> Jar It: Transfer the entire mixture into a clean, dry, and sterilized glass or ceramic jar, pressing the mango pieces down firmly. </li>
                         <li> Cure in Sunlight: Seal the jar with a lid and place it in direct sunlight for 7 to 10 days. The sunlight helps the fermentation process and softens the mangoes. </li>
                         <li>Stir Daily: Each day, open the jar and give the pickle a thorough mix with a clean, dry spoon, bringing the pieces from the bottom to the top. </li>
                         <li>Final Storage: After the mango pieces have softened and the flavors have melded (around 7-10 days), the pickle is ready. Ensure a layer of oil always floats above the pickle for preservation. Store the jar in a cool, dry place </li>
                         </ol>
